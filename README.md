# Heroes-SPA 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and is intended for development with React. Below are detailed instructions on how to set up and manage the project.

## Before Installation

To get started with this React project, follow these steps:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is necessary for installing dependencies.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Required for version control and managing the repository.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, you can run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands do not display version numbers, install Node.js from nodejs.org.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javilopezleza/heroes-spa-template
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd heroes-spa-template
```

## Starting Development Server

3. Install project dependencies if you havenâ€™t done so already:

```bash
npm install
```
or, if you prefer using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
or:

```bash
yarn start
```
This command starts a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files. You should see the React application running in your browser.

## Further Instructions

For more information on how to develop and deploy the application, refer to the official [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/) and the [React documentation](https://react.dev/).

Feel free to explore the repository and modify the application as needed for your own use case.
